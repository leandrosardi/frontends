# _templates
Here I host the HTML/CSS/JS templates that we use to create our websites.

Most of these templates have been provided by: https://wrapbootstrap.com.
Most of the icons that we use for our services are grabbed from free from: https://www.shareicon.net.

**IMPORTANT:** Never change the source code of these templates. Keep them as has been provided. Copy the source code to your project in order to use them.
